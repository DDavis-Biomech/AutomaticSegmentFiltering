function [ numChangePoints, CPs ] = changePoints(TKEO, MAD3)

% function uses the TKEO to determine the number of change-points in a
% given signal and lists the sample indexes where they occur

% locate where the TKEO is greater than the outlier criterion
Outliers = find(TKEO > MAD3);

% determine where the outlier samples break ie, going from one area of
% outliers to the next
ConsecBreaks = find(diff(Outliers) ~= 1);

% a single break indicates two outlier areas and so on
numOutlierAreas = length(ConsecBreaks) + 1;

% each outlier area counts as a segment plus the areas of the signal before
% and after these outlier areas
numSegments = (numOutlierAreas * 3) - length(ConsecBreaks);

% initialize the list of change points
CPs = zeros(1,numSegments-1);

% first change point is first instance of an outlier
CPs(1) = Outliers(1);

% successive change points occur at the break in consecutive sample indexes 
for i = 1:length(ConsecBreaks)
    CPs(i+1) = Outliers(ConsecBreaks(i));
    CPs(i+2) = Outliers(ConsecBreaks(i)+1);
end

% last change point is last instance of outlier
CPs(end) = Outliers(end);

numChangePoints = length(CPs);
