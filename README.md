# SegmentFiltering

  Within this repository:
  
  a) Noisy angular displacement data set and a reference angular acceleration signal with next to no noise from James Dowling (1985). Data set contains a non-stationary signal and is used as a benchmark for creating the Automatic Segment Filtering Procedure ('Dowling_1985_TestDataSet.xls'). 
  
  b) Code for processing this specific data set and implementing the proposed procedure.
  
  c) The accompanying accepted manuscript detailing the procedure.
