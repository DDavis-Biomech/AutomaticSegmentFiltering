# SegmentFiltering

  Within this repository will be:
  a) Noisy angular displacement data set and a reference angular acceleration signal with next-to-no noise from James Dowling (1985). Data set contains a non-stationary signal and is used as a benchmark for creating the Segment Filtering method. 
  b) Code for processing this specific data set and implementing the proposed method. 
  c) Example noisy data set with clear frequency changes to test the method.
