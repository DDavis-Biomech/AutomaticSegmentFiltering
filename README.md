# SegmentFiltering

  Within this repository will be:
  
  a) Noisy angular displacement data set and a reference angular acceleration signal with next to no noise from James Dowling (1985). Data set contains a non-stationary signal and is used as a benchmark for creating the Segment Filtering procedure. 
  b) Code for processing this specific data set and implementing the proposed procedure.
  c) An abstract presented at the International Society of Biomechanics Congress in Calgary, AB, Canada in August, 2019.
  d) *when available* the accompanying manuscript detailing the procedure.
  e) Example noisy data set with clear frequency changes to test the procedure.
